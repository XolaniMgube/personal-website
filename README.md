# My Portfolio Website

This is a responsive website that serves as my porfolio, it includes my CV, information about my background and the skills that I have, projects that I have worked on in the past and others that I am still working on.

This is a simple webpage with multiple web pages, it is still under construction as there are certain features that I would like to encoperate.

## Running the Website
The simplest way to run the website is by opening the `index.html` file which is in the root folder.
